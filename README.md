## The 3.1.5 cracked version of Paste suddenly became unavailable ðŸ˜„ðŸ¤£, and the data of the latest cracked version 4.1.2 cannot be synchronized, and the data of 3.1.5 cannot be used in 4.1.2ï¼Œthe clipboard data cannot be accessed from icloud also..

## Paste was too expensive and there was no payment method for one-time subscription. I planned(maybe) to use my free time to develop a alternative.
